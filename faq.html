            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <p class="question">Q: Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</p>
            <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children
                over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if
                their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children
                will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored
                children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world,
                and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things
                very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides
                are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

            <p class = "question">Q: Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</p>
            <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your
                safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of
                rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.</p>
            <p>Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device
                (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth
                and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the
                event that you fall out of the raft.</p>
            <hr />
            <p class="question">Q: What is included in the trip?</p>

                bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair.</p>

                and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You
                may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day,
                plus snacks.</p>

            <p class="question">Q: What do I need to bring?</p>
            <p>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both
                hot & dry and cold & wet.</p>
            <p>Rain jacket and rain pants: do not bring ponchos.</p>
            <p>Quick dry shirts and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days.  Button
                down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck.</p>
            <p>Light Weight Cotton Pants, Nylon Pants or Sarong are the best things for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts.
                If you are cold natured, bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom</p>
            <p>Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the day. Over the base layer,
                wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are
                hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom.</p>
            <p>Hat: a large brim hat that offers protection from the sun with a good quality strap.</p>
            <p>Sunglasses with strap.</p>
            <p>Socks: used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun.</p>
            <p>Sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before</p>

            <p class="question">Q: What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</p>
            <p>Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.</p>
            <p>Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a
                hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for
                the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories,
                and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or
                good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like
                steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After
                dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off
                to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>
            <hr />
            <p class="question">Q: How far in advance should I book my trip?</p>
            <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in
                advance is usually sufficient.</p>
